### Computational Syntax and Semantics

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Pregroup Representation of Hindi Syntax</th>
      <th align="center">Word Embedding in Non-Euclidian Spaces</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> I am working on a computational algebraic representation of
      Hindi syntax using pregroup calculus. This representation has
      been used for work in compositional distributional semantics, and
      it also lends insight into the computational nature of Hindi
      syntax including restricted word order alternation and multiword
      expressions. </td>
      <td> Why are words represented as vectors? What properties of a
      vector space can be interpretably translated by the principles of
      distributional semantics? In order to observe the nature of the
      metric space associated with language, I, alongwith a group, attempt to use various
      mathematical objects as the basis of a more interpretable lexical
      distributionl semantics. </td>

    <th>Computational Analysis of Misunderstanding</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ambiguity is one of the characteristics of natural language.
    However, in instructional texts, ambiguity, along with vagueness
    and other forms of misunderstanding can pose a problem in the
    execution of the instructions. I work with Dr. Michael Roth's
    group at the University of Stuttgart in order to analyze and
    computationally represent misunderstanding in a manner that can
    help identify and resolve it.</td>

### Temporal and Event Information Analysis

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">The Hindi TimeBank Project</th>
      <th align="center">Inference over Events</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Events are a pragmatic concept, a real world phenomenon
      represented in text by certain syntactic and semantic
      constructions. Events in text are used to represent time and
      termporality. With a team of researchers, I have been involved in
      the creation of a dataset that captures events in Hindi, alongwith
      their classification, time of occurence and other temporal
      information. </td>
      <td>Is there a way to parse and represent temporal information so
      as to represent the inherent sequential nature of events, the
      association of their respective participants and any other
      relations between two points of information? We attempt to answer
      that question using a queriable knowledge graph for inference and
      basic question answering. </td>

### NLP in Social Media

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Sexism on Social Media</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One of the most profound impacts of social media has been how
      people express their views, some more toxic than others. One of
      the prominent fallouts of this is sexist narratives in social
      media. I believe that there is extra-linguistic information, which adds the necessary context to suggest
      whether a post, comment, tweet etc. is sexist or not, and it can
      also help in knowing the nature of posts, comments and/or tweets
      which are most susceptible to be/contain sexist undertones or
      overtones.</td>
