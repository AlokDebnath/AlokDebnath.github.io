### Computational Syntax and Semantics

    <tr>
      <th align="center">Pregroup Representation of Hindi Syntax</th>
      <th align="center">Word Embedding in Non-Euclidian Spaces</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> I am working on a computational algebraic representation of
      HIndi syntax using pregroup calculus. This representation has
      been used for work in compositional distributional semantics, and
      it also lends insight into the computational nature of Hindi
      syntax including restricted word order alternation and multiword
      expressions. </td>
      <td> Why are words represented as vectors? What properties of a
      vector space can be interpretably translated by the principles of
      distributional semantics? In order to observe the nature of the
      metric space associated with language, I, alongwith a group, attempt to use various
      mathematical objects as the basis of a more interpretable lexical
      distributionl semantics. </td>

### Temporal and Event Information Analysis

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">The Hindi TimeBank Project</th>
      <th align="center">Inference over Events</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Events are a pragmatic concept, a real world phenomenon
      represented in text by certain syntactic and semantic
      constructions. Events in text are used to represent time and
      termporality. With a team of researchers, I have been involved in
      the creation of a dataset that captures events in Hindi, alongwith
      their classification, time of occurence and other temporal
      information. </td>
      <td>Is there a way to parse and represent temporal information so
      as to represent the inherent sequential nature of events, the
      association of their respective participants and any other
      relations between two points of information? We attempt to answer
      that question using a queriable knowledge graph for inference and
      basic question answering. </td>
