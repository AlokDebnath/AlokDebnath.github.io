### Computational Syntax and Semantics

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Pregroup Representation of Hindi Syntax</th>
      <th align="center">Word Embedding in Non-Euclidian Spaces</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> I am working on a computational algebraic representation of
      HIndi syntax using pregroup calculus. This representation has
      been used for work in compositional distributional semantics, and
      it also lends insight into the computational nature of Hindi
      syntax including restricted word order alternation and multiword
      expressions. </td>
      <td> Why are words represented as vectors? What properties of a
      vector space can be interpretably translated by the principles of
      distributional semantics? In order to observe the nature of the
      metric space associated with language, I, alongwith a group, attempt to use various
      mathematical objects as the basis of a more interpretable lexical
      distributionl semantics. </td>

### Temporal and Event Information Analysis

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">The Hindi TimeBank Project</th>
      <th align="center">Inference over Events</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Events are a pragmatic concept, a real world phenomenon
      represented in text by certain syntactic and semantic
      constructions. Events in text are used to represent time and
      termporality. With a team of researchers, I have been involved in
      the creation of a dataset that captures events in Hindi, alongwith
      their classification, time of occurence and other temporal
      information. </td>
      <td>Is there a way to parse and represent temporal information so
      as to represent the inherent sequential nature of events, the
      association of their respective participants and any other
      relations between two points of information? We attempt to answer
      that question using a queriable knowledge graph for inference and
      basic question answering. </td>

### NLP in Social Media

<table border="0">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Code-Mixed Language Hypotheses</th>
      <th align="center">Analysis of Tobacco related Tweets</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>There are multiple known linguistic hypotheses about code
      mixing and code switching, which pertain to cognitive, syntactic
      and semantic understanding of multilingual manner of language use.
      Using the treasure trove of code mixed data on social media,
      language models can be implemented to test these hypotheses and
      how well they model actual multilingual speech. </td>
      <td>Public Health Mentions (PHM) is a vital way of understanding
      public perception about facets of health, awareness and causes for
      new outbreaks (e.g. the Juul incident). One main topic is tobacco
      related tweets, where we aim to look into the types of tweets
      released about tobacco, the style of the viral tweets and the
      relative number of one over the other. We aim to use this to
      make better campaigns for social good. </td>

      <th>Semantic Importance of Emojis</th>
      <th>Multimodal Classification of Sexism</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do emojis contain any semantic information? One of the easiest
      ways of defining the semantic importance of emojis is through the
      use of sentence similarity measures, using a method of accounting
      for emoji representation. In working with a team, I aim to analyze
      the nature of emojis in social media text viz a viz their semantic
      importance and meaning associated with them.</td>
      <td>One of the most profound impacts of social media has been how
      people express their views, some more toxic than others. One of
      the prominent fallouts of this is sexist narratives in social
      media. I believe that images add the necessary context to suggest
      whether a post, comment, tweet etc. is sexist or not, and it can
      also help in knowing the nature of posts, comments and/or tweets
      which are most susceptible to be/contain sexist undertones or
      overtones.</td>
