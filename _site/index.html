			<h2>About Me</h2></header><p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am Alok Debnath, an undergraduate research student at the International
Institute of Information Technoogy, Hyderabad. My study primarily
focuses on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processsing,
though I am now foraying into more general machine learning as well. My
aim as an aspiring researcher in this complex field is to find a
computationally viable, mathematically interpretable and linguistically
motivated mechanism of representing, understanding and appreciating
language as a phenomenon.</p>
